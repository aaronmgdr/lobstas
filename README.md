# MKS: Lobsters Rails Project

This is a clone of [Lobsters](github.com/jcs/lobsters). 

It's been converted to run off sqlite rather than mysql. 

This is not a production ready codebase, rather the purpose of this working on this repo was to have a look at an existing Application, add a few features and fix a few bugs.

* fixes pagination if you have less than 2 pages of comments
* undelete searches for false rather than 0 (a mysql sqlite hickup)
* and more?
